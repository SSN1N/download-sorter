If you messy downloader like me, this will help la. Auto make folder and move same series files.


#How-to
Just move py script to messy folder. Make sure python is installed. Edit script to give correct source directory.
Open Terminal -> python Sorter.py -> Little cleaner downloads folder.


#Note
It only helps if you have files in series with same name like BlueMonke 1.jpg, BlueMonke 2.jpg ,BlueMonke 3.jpg; it simply makes a "Blue Monkey" folder and puts the crap in.
